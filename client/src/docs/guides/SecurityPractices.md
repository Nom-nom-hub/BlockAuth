# Security Best Practices

## Overview
This document outlines the security practices implemented in the application and provides guidance for maintaining a secure codebase and user experience.

## Authentication Security

### Password Security
- Passwords are hashed using bcrypt with appropriate salt rounds
- Password requirements enforce minimum length and complexity
- Failed login attempts are tracked and accounts are temporarily locked after multiple failures
- Password reset flows use secure, time-limited tokens sent via email

### JWT Security
- JWTs are signed with a strong secret key
- Short expiration times with automatic refresh mechanism
- Tokens are stored securely (HttpOnly cookies where possible)
- Tokens include only necessary claims to minimize payload size

### Wallet Authentication
- Challenge-response pattern prevents replay attacks
- Signatures are verified using standard Ethereum cryptography
- Nonces are used to prevent signature reuse
- Clear user consent is required for all signature requests

## API Security

### Input Validation
- All user inputs are validated on both client and server
- Schema validation using Mongoose for database operations
- Sanitization of inputs to prevent injection attacks
- Rate limiting on sensitive endpoints

### CORS Configuration
- Strict CORS policy with specific allowed origins
- Appropriate headers for modern browser security features
- Preflight request handling for complex requests

## Frontend Security

### State Management
- Sensitive data is not persisted in local storage
- Context API with proper state isolation
- Clear authentication state on logout or session expiration

### XSS Prevention
- React's built-in XSS protection
- Content Security Policy implementation
- Careful handling of user-generated content

## Development Practices

### Dependency Management
- Regular updates of dependencies
- Automated vulnerability scanning
- Careful evaluation of new dependencies

### Code Review
- Security-focused code reviews
- Automated static analysis
- Regular security audits

## Incident Response

### Monitoring
- Error logging and monitoring
- Unusual activity detection
- Performance monitoring

### Response Plan
- Defined process for security incidents
- Contact information for security team
- Disclosure policy for vulnerabilities

## Recommendations for Developers

1. **Never commit secrets** to the repository
2. **Always validate user input** on both client and server
3. **Keep dependencies updated** to patch security vulnerabilities
4. **Follow the principle of least privilege** when designing features
5. **Implement proper error handling** that doesn't leak sensitive information
