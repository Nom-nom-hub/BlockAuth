# Wallet Onboarding Guide

## Overview
This guide helps users set up and connect their blockchain wallets to the application. It covers wallet installation, connection, and troubleshooting.

## What is a Blockchain Wallet?

A blockchain wallet is a digital tool that allows users to interact with blockchain networks. It stores your private keys and enables you to:

- Send and receive cryptocurrency
- Sign messages and transactions
- Interact with decentralized applications (dApps)

Our application supports authentication using blockchain wallets, providing a passwordless login experience.

## Supported Wallets

The application currently supports:

- **MetaMask** (recommended for beginners)
- Other Ethereum-compatible wallets via WalletConnect

## Installation Guide

### MetaMask

1. **Install the browser extension**:
   - Visit [MetaMask.io](https://metamask.io/download/)
   - Select your browser and follow the installation instructions
   - Click "Create a new wallet" or "Import an existing wallet"

2. **Set up your wallet**:
   - Create a strong password
   - **IMPORTANT**: Write down your recovery phrase and store it securely
   - Never share your recovery phrase or private keys with anyone

3. **Configure the network**:
   - Click the network dropdown at the top of MetaMask
   - Select "Ethereum Mainnet" for production use
   - For testing, you can use "Goerli Test Network"

### Mobile Wallets

1. **Install the MetaMask mobile app**:

## Connecting to the Application

2. **Click "Login with Wallet"**
3. **Select your wallet provider** (MetaMask or WalletConnect)
4. **Approve the connection request** in your wallet
5. **Sign the authentication message** when prompted

The application will verify your signature and authenticate you based on your wallet address.

## First-Time Users

If this is your first time logging in with a wallet:

1. A new account will be created automatically
2. You'll be prompted to provide an email address (optional but recommended)
3. Your wallet address will be linked to your account

## Security Best Practices

- **Never share your private keys or recovery phrase**
- **Always verify the website URL** before connecting your wallet
- **Review all signature requests carefully** before approving
- **Consider using a hardware wallet** for additional security
- **Disconnect your wallet** when you're done using the application

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Wallet not detected**:
   - Ensure your wallet extension is installed and unlocked
   - Try refreshing the page

2. **Connection request not appearing**:
   - Check if your wallet is locked
   - Look for the wallet popup in your browser
